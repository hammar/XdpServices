http://descartes-core.org/ontologies/activities/1.0/ActivityPattern.owl;Activity Pattern;http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/images/d/d9/Activity3_small.png;To incorporate the general two perspectives of activities: a workflow perspective, which are often observed in planning-related applications, and a spatiotemporal perspective, which are often found in geographic activity analysis.;"WorkflowGeneral";"What are the requirements to complete an activity?Which places are involved in the activity?Can other planned activities/tasks be combined with this activity?Which chained activities are necessary to achieve this activity?Which activities are afforded by specific places?Where and when to acquire an activity-relevant object?";Activity is an important concept in many fields, and a number of activity-related ontologies have been developed. While suitable for their designated use cases, these ontologies cannot be easily generalized to other applications. This work aims at providing a generic ontology design pattern to model the common core of activities in different domains. Such a pattern can be used as a building block to construct more specific activity ontologies.;Only two perspectives for activities are included in this pattern. While these two perspectives are commonly observed in existing work, other views toward activities may also need to be supported in future work.;Activity or task planning.

The pattern purpose is not to encompass all linguistic complexity as Linginfo or LMF does, but to describe linguistic information in more details than SKOS which names concept whith simple labels.;"LinguisticVocabulary";"How to distinguish a preferred term or label from synonyms in order to name a concept?How to enable cross language searching?How to allow adding properties on term?";A concept is named in a particular language by a preferred term and a set of simple non preferred terms. Those terms artifacts specialize the term entity which owns common properties. This list of properties may be extended depending on vocabulary specific needs. This pattern suits for various vocabularies (thesaurus, terminology, taxonomyâ€_) and has been applied to GEMET, Eurovoc, CIM10 among other. Modeling takes into account: -the possibility to extend the current pattern in order to add some more precise linguistic information (for instance represent translation relation between two terms since term is a class) -minimal linguistic artifacts necessary for vocabulary resource access by providing a preferred Term to name a concept and some synonyms which are Simple non preferred terms.;Compare to labels on a concept class, this solution has a higher data load.;"Used for vocabulary representation. For example in Eurovoc(http://europa.eu/eurovoc/)a concept has a preferred term ""social sciences"" in english and a simple non preferred term (i.e. synonyms) ""humanities"" in the same language whereas the same concept has a preferred term ""sciences sociales"" in french and a simple non preferred term ""sciences humaines"" in this language. If we wanted to add a translation relation between terms we could state that ""social sciences"" english term is a translation of ""sciences sociales"" french term. If we consider a second preferred term in english ""award"" which names a conceptin a particular information retrieval contextwe could define a coumpound non preferred term ""social sciences awards"" which is related to preferred terms ""social sciences"" and ""award""."

http://delicias.dia.fi.upm.es/ontologies/SimpleOrAggregated.owl;SimpleOrAggregated;http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/images/f/f5/CP-SoA-01v1.jpg;The goal of this pattern is to represent objects that can be simple or aggregated (that is, several objects gathered in another object acting as a whole). The main difference between the aggregation relation and other mereological relationships (such as part-of or componency) is that the aggregated object and its aggregated members should belong to the same concept. For example, a turbine is part of an engine, whereas an aggregated provider is formed by providers.;Parts and Collections;"What elements are aggregated members of this object?What is this object aggregated member of?";"The class ""ObjectByCardinality"" has been created to classify simple and aggregated objects into its subclasses ""SimpleObject"" and ""AggregatedObject"", respectively. These subclasses are disjoint among them. The aggregation relationship between objects means that objects can be composed by other objects. This relationship is represented by the transtive property ""hasAggregatedMember"" and its inverse ""isAggregatedMemberOf"". These properties have as subproperties the non transitive properties ""hasDirectAggregatedMember"" and its inverse ""isDirectAggregatedMemberOf"", respectively. By means of this structure of properties, we provide a mechanism (a) to represent transitive aggregation relationships (that is, if A has B as aggregated member and B has C as aggregated member then A has C as aggregated member) and (b) to link each aggregated member just to the next level (that is, A has B as direct aggregated member). Finally, the class ""AggregatedObject"" has been defined as equivalent to those things that have some values for the property ""hasAggregatedMember"". This modelling allows the automatic classification of aggregated objects in this class when a reasoner is applied.";"This Content OP allows designers to represent both simple individuals of a given concept (that is, an individual that is made up of itself) and aggregated individuals of a given concept (that is, an individual that is made up of several individuals of the same concept). In summary, this pattern allows to represent both simple objects and aggregated objects and their members. In addition, this pattern can be used to detect the following contradictory situation by means of applying a reasoner: 'to instantiate the relationship ""hasAggregatedMember"" for an Object that belongs to ""SimpleObject""'. This situation represents a consistency error and it is detected when a resoner is applied due to the following modelling decisions included in the pattern: (a) ""AggregatedObject"" class represents the ""hasAggregatedMember"" domain and (b) ""AggregatedObject"" is disjoint with ""SimpleObject"".";A service provider can be simple or be an aggregate of a set of service providers.

The pattern can be used across domains in scenarios where a reactor is used to run processes that consume inputs to produce outputs under controlled environmental conditions and when triggered by certain events. As an example, the pattern has been applied to the algal biomass domain to model the reactive process of algae cultivation.;The main advantage of this pattern is that its provides ontological modelling capabilities for the inputs, outputs and environmental conditions that govern reactive processes across several domains, independent of modelling details of the actual reactor involved. This effectively caters for exposing a black box view of the process, which is very desirable when querying the model for consumption and production logistics of the process.;"As an exemplifier for the reactor patternwe present a use case fromthe domain of algal biomass. We employ the reactor pattern in anontology OntoMDL. The ontology models a process for algal biomasscultivation.

It is particularly useful for cases in which two or more agents provide different, contradictory information about the same event. It can be also used for modelling situation in which a single agent provided contradictory information about the same event in different points in time. In general the pattern allows for stating different circumstances of an act of the information provision.;"GeneralEvent Processing";"What characteristics (date/participants/cause etc.) is an actual event said to have?Which agent made a statement about an actual event?On which sources these statements were based?What were circumstances of providing information about an actual event?";There are in total 3 different types of events included in the pattern. The most important one is the ActualEvent, which is the physical event -- event that actually happened or is said to have happened. All the circumstances of the event (contexts) are not directly linked to the ActualEvent. They are attached to the ReportedEvent, which constitutes a view of the actual event included in a particular description/report/statement. By making the ReportedEvent an Event, we can use all properties that could be used in case of an ordinary event, like place, time interval, cause and consequences. They are grouped in a class ReportedEventContext and are attached by hasContext property or its specialisations. As ReportedEvent provides an information about the ActualEvent entity, it can be viewed as InformationObject. It is connected to an ActualEvent using the isAbout property. The third event included in our pattern is the act of reporting the actual event -- the ReportingEvent. Its result is an ReportedEvent (linked using property reports). By modelling the act of reporting as an event, we can expose its different circumstances, for example the timestamp at which the particular reporting took place. The ReportingEvent can be also viewed as an activity, performed by a certain agent (person or organisation) -- EventReporter, utilising defined sources.;The pattern is rather complex and should only be used if the circumstances of the events are expected to be uncertain (to differ in different event reports).;Two History professors have different opinion about the same actual event.

The pattern is flexible and compositional. It can be exploited to include few or more guidelines from multiple standards and can be easily combined with other patterns.;The pattern can be applied to use cases in all those domains where a standard is enforced to regulate processes. The main advantage of this pattern is that it provides the capability to link processes, operations, activities and services to their governing standards in a generic and compositional manner. In some scenarios it is possible that a process or an operation does not enforce all prescribed guidelines but enforces atleast some. The pattern accounts for that through the definition of the process enforcing the standard.;"As an exemplifier for SEPwe present a use case from the domain of algal biomass production which depicts the application of SEP to an ontology that models algal biomass production. The Minimum Descriptive Language (MDL) standard proposed by the Algal Biomass Association is enforced by the production operation.

In this use casethe ontology defines the concepts and relationships for the operation and incorporates SEP by enforcing a guideline for measuring Carbon input to the operation."

The diagram presents an example of the usage of the pattern, for an easier understanding. The individuals <code style=""font-size:larger;"">x1</code>, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">x2</code> and <code style=""font-size:larger;"">x3</code> have a reified property <code style=""font-size:larger;"">p</code> that have as values the reified individuals, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y1</code>, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y2</code> and <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y3</code>, respectively. In OWL, we would have object property assertions: <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(x1 p y1)</code>, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(x2 p y2)</code>, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(x3 p y3)</code>. The properties for the reified individuals, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y1</code>, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y2</code> and <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y3</code> are all identical: <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(y_ p1 foo)</code>, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(y_ p2 1.0)</code> and <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(y_ p3 z)</code>. The pattern proposes to create a template instance, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y_tmpl</code> having the common values as its property values: <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(y_tmpl p1 foo), (y_tmpl p2 1.0), (y_tmpl p3 z)</code> The template instance would be used as the value for the reified property for <code style=""font-size:larger;"">x1</code>, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">x2</code> and <code style=""font-size:larger;"">x3</code>: <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(x1 p y_tmpl), (x2 p y_tmpl), (x3 p y_tmpl)</code> In addition, we will also add one annotation property, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">isTemplate:true</code>, on <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y_tmpl</code> to mark that it as a template instance. The intention is that the template instance is immutable, i.e., the property values of the template instance cannot be changed. <br /> In the case that a user would like to change a property value of the reified relation, a clone of the template instance would be created and the change would occur on the clone. An ontology editor would use the <var>isTemplate</var> annotation property to check that a certain instance cannot be modified, and it should rather create a clone. The right side of the diagram gives an example of this situation. Say that at a given time t<sub>0</sub>, there was an additional x4 individual that had the template instance as the value for p. At t<sub>0</sub>: <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(x4 p y_tmpl)<br /> Â Â Â Â Â (y_tmpl p1 foo), (y_tmpl p2 1.0), (y_tmpl p3 z)</code> Later, at time t<sub>1</sub>, the user decides to change the value <code style=""font-size:larger;"">p1</code> on x4 from â€œfooâ€ù to â€œbarâ€ù. The ontology editor (or the user, if there is no support in the tool), will see the <var>isTemplate</var> annotation property on <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y_tmpl</code> as set on true, and it will create a clone of it, <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y_tmpl_modif</code>, by cloning also all the object and data property axioms. Then, it will change the value of <code style=""font-size:larger;"">p1</code> on <code style=""font-size:larger;"">y_tmpl_modif</code>. So, the result will be: At t<sub>1</sub>: <code style=""font-size:larger;"">(x4 p y_tmpl_modif)<br /> Â Â Â Â Â (y_tmpl_modif p1 bar), (y_tmpl_modif p2 1.0), (y_tmpl_modif p3 z)</code> <br /> As a result of using the Template Instance pattern, one could reduce the number of data and object property axioms in the ontology. This â€œdeflationâ€ù of the ontology is especially significant, if there are many repetitive values in the ontology, with very few changes, and if the number of properties of the reified instances is large.";;

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HollyFerguson/Spatial-Graph-Adapter-Pattern/master/SGA_Protege_OWL.owl;Spatial Graph Adapter (SGA) Pattern;;Link to OWL File: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HollyFerguson/Spatial-Graph-Adapter-Pattern/master/SGA_Protege_OWL.owl PDF of SGA Pattern Image: [[Image:USOcore3.pdf|600px|thumb|center|SGA Pattern]] To answer the modern, interdisciplinary questions asked within the Building domain, industry tools and data standards need to become far more interoperable in order to be able to provide a full and accurate set of analysis to engineers and designers. To provide this full picture from which to make decisions, we needed a way to resolve the spatial data that tools provide in order to synthesize it together. In addition to missing, incorrect, and inconsistent information, there is also the challenge of not being able to use existing spatial patterns to capture the full granularity or specificity of the geospatial descriptions required to capture full and dynamic geometric contexts. The Spatial Graph Adapter (SGA) pattern provides us a way to extend the simple identification of geometries and simultaneously assign further descriptions and self-context as well as contextual and relational references to other spatial objects in or surrounding the original entity. For example, not only can we use existing notions say that one surface is adjacent to another, but we have a way to say exactly what type of adjacency and to what extent it is adjacent (more examples in accompanying paper). The SGA has also been implemented for several building industry schemas and our further research is in bringing this and other patterns into full use in a Linked Data Platform (ongoing).;Http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Community:Building and Construction;1. What spaces is this damaged structural beam a part of (without needing to iterate through every existing spatial component or coordinate set)? 2. Exactly how much of this structural element is exposed and to what spaces? 3. What are all of the spatial elements in this graph that contain void spaces (air spaces in assemblies that could be susceptible to damage)? 4. What thermal or occupancy zones is this assembly associated with (these may or may not have to do with adjacency or locality)? 5. What sets of columns are responsible for supporting floors X and Y?;After several iterations of studying building industry data standards (in particular, GBXML, IFC, and CityGML), we began to map not only terms between them, but also conceptual level indicators. First we capture the main spatial arrangement of geometric elements which are extracted automatically from a spatial instance file. Secondly, the SGA pattern allows us to contextualize additional relationships to capture schema-specific ideas to ultimately be able to ask all the data questions simultaneously. We do acknowledge that in several cases there could be benefits to aligning it with other mereotopological or SIO pattern concepts, but these have not been necessary thus far. Even if we use a common definition for adjacency, such as where two objects would be touching could be considered adjacent, this fails when we want to know, say what columns or walls are adjacent to a space. It is true that they may be touching some building geometries, but what about the cases where you would have adjacent columns, but they are touching only the open air that define that side of a space (not touching but still on that visual or schema induced boundary)? The SGA pattern allows us to extract this type of information and add it as Attributes or ContextualizedRelations to other objects, solving this issue by being able to, for example, group building elements even as what may seem arbitrary in isolated examples. Schemas produce a wide array of these situations, and even more when we start to translate between them.;[[Image:USOcore3.jpg|700px|thumb|center|SGA Pattern]] With the capabilities the SGA pattern provides, it has been found to be useful and as been implemented for IFC, GBXML, and CityGML is currently in progress. Once this mapping was produced and captured via this pattern, further work was possible and completed in the form of View helper files and all of this is being worked into an operational Linked Data Platform to further enhance open data exchange. Our work was inspired by ideas from Spatial Information Theory, biomedical research for the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO), Mereotopology, and geospatial data efforts via the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), although these are not the only works regarding spatial descriptions.;"IFCGBXMLand CityGML (current work)"
